# automata
Bunch of lab code. **THIS NEEDS ORGANIZATION**.

### Future Plans/To Do
 - `wrapomatic` to be exported, because it will have so many external-tool dependencies. Best to put that in another library that's independent of automata.
 - `treesubsub` to be exported into its own script repo. Put here first just for PATH convenience. 
 - Too many utils libraries! Merge them.
