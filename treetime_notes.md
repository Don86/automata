# An Introduction to `treetime`

## 3 Main Features of `treetime`

1. Given a `fasta` file of aligned sequences, a `csv` file of those sequences and their respective dates, and a tree in newick format, estimate a dated tree. Basic outputs:
 - Ancestral sequences (ML inference given a tree topology and branch lengths)
 - Plot of the dated tree
